  <h1>Why do I want to learn this skill?</h1>
  <h4>What does it mean to you? What are your motivations? Will you prove
    something to yourself or people around you? Will you get a raise because
    you’re better at your job or will you get a better job?</h4>
  <p>
    I would like to build a website as an entry-level way of getting into programming.
    My plan is to use the site I create as a way to keep track of the progress I am making
    with programming. I can use the website to prototype certain ideas, to write notes to
    myself about what I am accomplishing, and perhaps even use it as a platform to show off
    other projects.
  </p>

  <h1>What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</h1>
  <h4>Which doors will this skill open for you? Will you be able to earn more,
    have more flexibility in your work hours, work remotely and travel more?</h4>
  <p>
    Ultimately, I would love to switch careers, but currently I am trying not to look
    at this skill as a way of making money. I do plan to return to college for an
    electronic circuitry/embedded programming focused education, and this website
    will be used as a tool to show off my skills in that field rather than in web
    development itself.
  </p>

  <h1>How will this skill change my life and my career?</h1>
  <h4>Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss
    once you’ve learnt this skill? Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google
    instead? How would your life change?</h4>
  <p>
    I believe this skill can only change my life for the better. I have always loved
    the idea of programming, and wanted to double major in it during my first stint
    in college. However, the demands of time and money put a doubt in my mind that
    kept me from pursuing it. Now, looking back, I am nearly positive I could have
    pursued programming easily, and I regret not having done that because it's a
    career I'd much prefer being in. I will not use this skill at my current job, nor
    do I have much of a desire to work at a big mainstream tech company. We'll see
    what happens!
  </p>

  <h1>How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family, friends and
    coworkers?</h1>
  <h4>What will you be able to do for your family or friends once you’ve learnt
    this skill? How will it change the way they think of you? Will your coworkers
    respect you more?</h4>
  <p>
    One of my motivations for learning how to build a website is to make a "hub"
    of all the goings on in my life. If I make something I like the look of, I'd
    like to have the website hosted, and give the link to all my family and friends.
    That way, if they have a desire to see what I'm up to, they can check there
    for updates.
  </p>

  <h1>How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</h1>
  <h4>Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like you’ve missed out?</h4>
  <p>
    I have felt a massive regret for not pursing programming during my first time at
    college. I have plans to return Fall 2020 (hopefully). During the time between
    now and then, I'm trying to dive deep into this skill to see if it's what I
    truly desire, and maybe find out if any additional interests get planted in my mind.
  </p>

  <h1>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?</h1>
  <h4>Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the
    time you go to sleep? Will you be living by the sea? Would you kiss your
    beautiful wife/husband when you wake up?</h4>
  <p>
    If I get enough competence to pursue a programming job, that will greatly boost
    my income. I could finally buy a house, support a girlfriend, and maybe one day
    a family. That is my dream.
